WKTool
======
WKTool is a verification tool for weighted Kripke structures.
It permits the specification of systems by the means of a CCS-like language.
Properties are expressed using a weighted dialect of computation tree logic.

The verification engine relies on fixed point computation on dependency graphs 
(See: _Xinxin Liu, Scott A. Smolka: Simple Linear-Time Algorithms for Minimal Fixed Points_).
Queries may also be encoded in symbolic dependency graphs, which can be more efficient for
large bounds. Moreover, the engine supports both global and on-the-fly exploration of the
state-space.

You can [try WKTool here](http://wktool.jonasfj.dk).
Note that this is mainly a proof of concept project, hence some parts of the source code could be more maintainable.
